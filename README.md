## Workflow

### Pull Requests

- Creates a Pulumi preview for any changed stacks
- Posts the preview as a comment on the PR
- No changes are applied until merge

### Main Branch

- Automatically applies infrastructure changes for modified stacks
- Uses AWS OIDC for authentication
- Only runs on stacks that have changes since the last commit

## Stack Organization

Each stack manages DNS and related infrastructure for a specific domain:

- Configuration is in `Pulumi.yaml` and `Pulumi.prod.yaml`
- DNS records are organized by type (email, web, etc.)
- Secrets are encrypted using AWS KMS
